# ELRO Connects python implementation
The ELRO Connects uses a propriety protocol on the local network over UDP. This is the reversed engineered python implementation of the protocol.

The ERLO connects system allows you to connect fire alarms, heat alarms, CO alarms, water alarms and door/window sensors through a hub. The app uses an internet connection, but on the local network it is possible to communicate with the hub through a propriety UDP protocol.

This is the initial setup, still working on expanding the implementation. Feel free to test and or add code.
